# 1. Installation

In order to execute this project, the following libraries were used
- Numpy library
- Pandas library
- Seaborn library
- matplotlib
- Python version 3.8.5

# 2. Project Motivation

This project is about programming languages and how they are related with some of the most important professional aspects like job satisfaction and annual salaries. The project also use hypothesis testing to compare the salaries of developers who have python experience and developers who have experience with other programming languages. It is important to deeply know the professional aspects presented in this project before starting a career in python programming and data science.

# 4. How To Interact With The Project

The population used for the study was 32518 developers who responded to the StackOverflow survey and who have annual salaries between 2000 and 300000$

It was found that the top 3 most popular languages in the labour market are C, Java and JavaScript. The graphs of the present project show a ranking of the quantity of developers of the survey who have worked with each programming language shown in the figure. 

It was also found that the job satisfaction is higher in developers who have some experience working with Julia, Haskell and Bash/Shell/PowerShell. The "Mean job satisfaction by programming language" graph shows a comparison of the job satisfaction by programming language and shows that the programming language does not affect too much the job satisfaction.

It was found that the programming language it is more strongly correlated to the annual salary than to the job satisfaction in the population studied in this work. Developers who have some experience working with Scala, Perl and Rust tended to have higher annual salaries. The graph titled "Mean annual salary by programming language" shows a comparison between the salaries of developers who have some experience working woth eac programming language.

Finally, it was also found (with statistical significance = 95%) that developers with some python experience have higher salaries than developers with experience in the following languages: 'TypeScript', 'C++', 'Kotlin', 'C#', 'VBA', 'SQL', 'C', 'JavaScript', 'Java', 'HTML/CSS', 'Dart' and 'PHP'.
